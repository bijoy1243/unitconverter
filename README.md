## Overview

Welcome to the **UnitConverter** repository! This R package allows you to easily convert between various units of measurement, including temperature, weight, and length. This project serves as the final submission for the CS50R course, showcasing the application of concepts learned throughout the program.

You can download the latest version of the package from the [Releases section](https://github.com/bijoy1243/unitconverter/releases). 

## Features

- **Temperature Conversion**: Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- **Weight Conversion**: Easily switch between kilograms, grams, pounds, and ounces.
- **Length Conversion**: Convert between meters, kilometers, feet, and miles.
- **Error Handling**: The package includes robust error handling to ensure accurate conversions.
- **Testing**: Uses the `testthat` package for unit testing to ensure reliability.

## Installation

To install the **UnitConverter** package, you can use the following command in R:

```R
devtools::install_github("bijoy1243/unitconverter")
```

Make sure you have the `devtools` package installed. If not, install it using:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

## Usage

After installation, load the package in your R environment:

```R
library(unitconverter)
```

### Temperature Conversion

To convert temperatures, use the `convert_temperature` function:

```R
convert_temperature(value, from_unit, to_unit)
```

**Example**:

```R
convert_temperature(100, "Celsius", "Fahrenheit")
```

### Weight Conversion

For weight conversions, use the `convert_weight` function:

```R
convert_weight(value, from_unit, to_unit)
```

**Example**:

```R
convert_weight(10, "kilograms", "pounds")
```

### Length Conversion

For length conversions, use the `convert_length` function:

```R
convert_length(value, from_unit, to_unit)
```

**Example**:

```R
convert_length(5, "meters", "feet")
```

## Error Handling

The package includes error handling to manage invalid inputs. If an invalid unit is provided, the package will return an informative error message.

### Example of Error Handling

```R
convert_temperature(100, "Celsius", "InvalidUnit")
# Error: Invalid unit provided. Please use Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
```

## Testing

We use the `testthat` package to ensure the functions work as expected. To run the tests, use:

```R
devtools::test()
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available within the package. You can access it using:

```R
?convert_temperature
?convert_weight
?convert_length
```
